Comments
        Comments should be used whenever:


1. The usage of a piece of code is ambiguous. It has no clearly defined purpose, or the syntax/variables are confusing.


2. A piece of code is deprecated, but may become useful in the future.


3. To list changes in variables that may be reverted later.


4. To plan future code
